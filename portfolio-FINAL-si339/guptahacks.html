			<p>As a fellow of the Entrepreneurs Leadership program, I was very fortunate to secure an internship with Michigan Medicine in their Office of Development and Donar relations. For this position, I was in charge of planning a Health Communication Hackathon for CNN correspondent and Neurosurgeon, Dr. Sanjay Gupta. In the first few months, the event was nothing but an idea. I cam up with success metrics, the project timeline, the sizing and sponsorship strategy and venue selection. During my internship, I wanted to learn more and increase my expertise about hackathons, so I went to a local hackathon called "A2 Health Hacks" where I met the founding team and built relationships with them to receive advice and guidance on my own project. I also drove my self out to Pennsylvania for Hackcon which is a camp for Hackathon organizers. In the middle of the woods with surprisingly great wifi, we attended workshops and met other students to share best practices and key insights for putting on a successful hackathon.</p>

			<p>I spent almost a year working and planning the event and got to meet Sanjay Gupta who is incredibly inspiring. We were lucky to have Jeff Arnold, found of WebMD at the event as well. Having both Sanjay and Jeff at the event got participants very excited. Both gentlemen were kind enough to stick around for an extended period of time to talk and mentor the hackers. Our goal was to have 30 problem pitches and 20 final presentations. However, as the event went underway, we had 45 problem pitches and 30 final presentations. I was very lucky to be a part of this project and had many opportunities to challenge myself, step outside my comfort zone and take a leadership role.</p>
