      <p>
        Take this kiss upon the brow!
        And, in parting from you now,
        Thus much let me avow--
        You are not wrong, who deem
        That my days have been a dream;
        Yet if hope has flown away
        In a night, or in a day,
        In a vision, or in none,
        Is it therefore the less gone?
        All that we see or seem
        Is but a dream within a dream.

        I stand amid the roar
        Of a surf-tormented shore,
        And I hold within my hand
        Grains of the golden sand--
        How few! yet how they creep
        Through my fingers to the deep,
        While I weep--while I weep!
        O God! can I not grasp
        Them with a tighter clasp?
        O God! can I not save
        One from the pitiless wave?
        Is all that we see or seem
        But a dream within a dream?
      </p>
      <p>
        I carry your heart with me(i carry it in
        my heart)i am never without it(anywhere
        i go you go,my dear; and whatever is done
        by only me is your doing,my darling)
        i fear
        no fate(for you are my fate,my sweet)i want
        no world(for beautiful you are my world,my true)
        and it's you are whatever a moon has always meant
        and whatever a sun will always sing is you

        here is the deepest secret nobody knows
        (here is the root of the root and the bud of the bud
        and the sky of the sky of a tree called life;which grows
        higher than the soul can hope or mind can hide)
        and this is the wonder that's keeping the stars apart
