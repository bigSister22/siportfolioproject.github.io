            <p>In the first semester of my senior year, I took an incredible class where we learned about design processes. We went all the way from ideating, to sketching, to paper prototypes, to low through high fidelity prototypes. Our team was four people and we all knew each other before going into the class. This was neat because we worked really well together. We had a great understanding of each other's strengths and weaknesses and were able to use this understanding to our advantage. We ended with one of the best projects and digital prototypes in the class.</p>

        <div class="col-sm-6">
            <p>Out of our team of 4, everyone but 1 person had experience with music production. On top of having something to talk about and bond over, our expertise using digital audio workstations allowed us to sit down and talk about them from a design perspective. One person used Abelton and another used Logic Pro X. We would meet as a group and talk about the interface features that we liked and didn't like before we started designing. We eventually had the idea of streamlining the entire process of making a track by breaking songs up into pieces and allowing users to create a song in a back-and-forth manner. For example, one person adds the drums, their partner can then add another piece like the melody and then it goes back to the first to add the next piece. We all had a ton of fun working on the project and got some real buy-in from other music producers in Ann Arbor about the idea.</p>

            <p>Featured here is an example of one of the stages of our design process. We took our user personas, put them in an imaginary narrative and thought about how their journey through our interface would look. Hashing all this out on paper and as a team in a comfortable and trusting environment really allowed us to understand each other's perspectives and use our diversity in both experience and knowledge to prototype something awesome.</p>
