            <p>As part of my capstone for the Entrepreneurs Leadership Program, I decided to start a drop shipping business by creating a Shopify store online. For those that don't understand drop shipping, I would list products (many of which from China) on my website at a price higher than what I knew I could get them for from my supplier. What makes drop shipping unique is that I never carried any inventory. If someone placed an order on my site, they would pay me and I would go purchase the product from my supplier and ship it to my customer for a profit without ever having touched it.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-12">
            <p>One of my ideas from the start was to sell products that in a way, market themselves. What I mean by this is that the product was unique or funny and it had a clear and targetable demographic. From here I would do what I called meme marketing. I would make a photo and ask people to tag their friends. I would then have a link back to my store for people to visit.</p>

        <div class="col-sm-12">
            <p>One of the biggest learning experiences came from learning to use the Facebook ad console. I spent a lot of time doing split ads where I could see single variables performance against each other. I spent a lot of time researching weightlifters and the brands they buy from and the gyms that they go to. From there, I was able to make very targeted Facebook advertisements to reach them. Facebook gave me a relevance score of 9 which means my ads were performing better for the cost than most other ads on Facebook.</p>
